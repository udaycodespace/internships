# Anime Recommender using Unsupervised Learning 🎯

## Objective 🔍  
Build a content-based anime recommendation system using clustering—no user history required.

---

## About the Project 📘  
Developed during a 4-week AI + Azure Internship (May 2025) by **Edunet Foundation**, this project recommends anime titles using unsupervised learning (K-Means) based on synopsis and genre.

---

## Project Workflow 📊  
![Overview](./project_overview.png)  
*A visual summary of data flow and tools used.*

## Dataset 📂

This dataset is used in this Python 3 project for analyzing anime rankings, ratings, genres, and other metadata.

**Source**:  
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quanthan/top-15000-ranked-anime-dataset-update-to-32025

### Modifications Made:
- Renamed the original file to `anime_2025.csv` for consistency with project naming.
- Removed the `japanese_name` column due to parsing issues.

### Usage:
```python
import pandas as pd
anime_df = pd.read_csv("anime_2025.csv")
```

The dataset includes 15,000 entries with key fields like:
- `name`, `english_name`, `genres`, `score`, `type`, `episodes`, `source`, `rating`, `rank`, `popularity`, etc.

Used for exploratory analysis, vectorization of synopses, and genre-based clustering.

## Methodology 🛠️  

1. **Load Data**: Anime info including synopsis, genres, and scores.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and vectorize synopses using **TF-IDF**.  
3. **Clustering**: Apply **K-Means** to group similar anime.  
4. **Recommendation**: Suggest titles from the same cluster as input anime.

---

## Example 💡  
**Input**: `"Naruto"`  
**Output**: Similar anime like _"Angel Beats!"_, _"Platinum End"_ etc. 🎥

## Run Instructions ▶️  

1. Open `Unsupervised_Anime_Recommendation_System.ipynb` in Google Colab or locally.  
2. Execute all cells:  
    - Load dataset  
    - Preprocess & vectorize  
    - Fit model  
    - Call the function below:

```python
get_recommendations('Bleach') 
get_recommendations('Naruto')
get_recommendations('Bleech')  # typo test with fuzzy matching
```

---

## Tech Stack 🧰  
- Python (Colab)  
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (optional for visuals)  
- `nltk` (optional for NLP)

---

## Future Scope 🔮  

- Web interface (Flask/Streamlit)  
- Add collaborative filtering  
- Include user reviews  
- Filter-based recommendations (genre/score)
